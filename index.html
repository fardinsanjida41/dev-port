                My Neighbor Totoro is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and
                animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten. The film—which stars the voice actors Noriko Hidaka, Chika

            <h3> The supernatural spirit</h3>
            <p>In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei
                (approximately ten and four years old, respectively), move into an old house to be closer to the
                hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited
                by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari which can be seen when moving from bright to
                dark places.</p>
